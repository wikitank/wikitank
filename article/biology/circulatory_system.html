                    ; The Circulatory system is a transportation system by which oxygen and nutrients reach the body's cells, and waste materials are carried away. It also carries substances called hormones, which control body processes, and antibodies to fight invading germs.

                    ;*
                        ;- Two cycles
                        ;- Heart acts as double pump
                        ;- Blood from the right side pump is dark red and low in oxygen (oxygen-poor)
                        ;- Travels through pulmonary arteries to lungs where it gets fresh oxygen and becomes bright red
                        ;- Blood from lungs through pulmonary veins back to the heart's left side pump
                        ;- Pumped out into the body
                    ;**

                    ; Circulation devided into three major parts:
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- The Heart
                        ;- The Blood
                        ;- The Blood Vessels
                    ;**
                    ; The heart, the lungs and the blood vessels work together to form the s{ circle}.[underline] part of the circulatory system.
                    
                    ; 3 kinds of Circulation:
                    ;*.[lml]
                        ;- Pulmonary circulation (lungs)
                        ;- Coronary circulation (supports the heart)
                        ;- Systemic circulation
                    ;**

                    ---
                    ;###.[sub] Coronary Circulation
                    ; Movement of blood through the tissues of the heart

                    ---
                    ;###.[sub] Systemic Circulation
                    ; Supplies nourishment to all of the tissue located throughout the body, except for the heart and lungs. All parts of the body must be oxygenated to survive.

                    ;###.[sub] Arteries
                    ;*
                        ;- Carries blood away from the heart
                        ;- Heart pumps blood
                        ;- The preassure in arteries is high, therefore an injury to an artery can lead to massive blood loss
                        ;- The main artery is known as the s{ Aorta }.[underline]
                        ;- Aorta divides and branches
                        ;- Many smaller arteries
                        ;- Each region of your body has system of arteries supplying it fresh, oxygen-rich blood.
                    ;**
                    ; Arteries are tough on the outside & smooth on the inside (for better flow). Muscular walls help the heart pump blood.

                    ---
                    ;###.[sub] Capillaries
                    ;*
                        ;- Very thin, only one cell thick
                        ;- Connect arteries and veins
                        ;- Food and oxygen are released to the body's cells
                        ;- Carbon dioxide and other waste products returned to the bloodstream
                    ;**

                    ---
                    ;###.[sub] Veins
                    ;*
                        ;- Carry blood to the heart 
                        ;- Recieve blood from the capillaries
                        ;- Transport waste-rich/oxygen-poor (except in pulmonary circulation) blood back to the heart 
                        ;- Valves are located inside the veins which restrict the blood to moving in one direction
                    ;**
                    ; Valves are located inside the veins. The valves only allow blood to move in one direction.
