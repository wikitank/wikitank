            <h1>History and theories</h1>
            <p><b><i>Matter</i></b> is anything that has mass and volume (occupies space).</p>
			<p>Thales (600 BCE): <i>"water is <b>protosubstance</b> - it's a first form of ice, liquid and vapour"</i> (Protosubstance is the term that describes a hypothetical, undifferentiated state of matter or energy from which all forms of matter and energy arise).<br/><i>"Matter: something which occupies a volume"</i> (it was defined as theory in those time).</p>
			<p>Empedocles (400 BCE): <i>"air occupies a volume and must thus be matter."<br/>Matter is composed of <b>"the four elements</b>: earth, air, fire and water."</i><br/>Empedocles was not alone: a similar line of thought could be found in many different cultures</p>
			<p>Democritos (contemporary with Empedocles) thought otherwise: he proposed that matter was composed of atoms.<br/> Platon rejected this idea: if air was composed of small particles, they would fall to the ground like dust!<br/>Platon and, particularly, Aristoteles made sure that the theory of ”The Four Elements” persisted until the 19th century!<br/>Up till this day it is common that some very successful scientists become ”authorities” with a large impact.</p>
			<p>Boyle (17th century) introduced something similar to Democritos’ idea that everything is composed of atoms:<i>"Air consists of small particles (”corpuscles”) and the higher the pressure, the smaller the distance between the particles"</i><br/>Dalton (1766-1844) discovered that gases and other substances react with each other in fixed proportions: "if you let tin ($Sn$) burn in the presence of oxygen ($O_2$) two different compounds are formed:</p>
			<ul style="width: fit-content; min-width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
				<li>One of them contains $88.1\%$ w/w $Sn$ and $11.9\%$ w/w $O$</li>
				<li>The other contains $78.7\%$ w/w $Sn$ och $21.3\%$ w/w $O$</li>
			</ul>
			$$Sn+O_2\rightarrow SnO+SnO_2$$
